# McGlas

The McGlas Project aims to maintain a full list of Coca Cola® glasses ever issued by McDonalds®. **The scope is currently limited to Germany**.

This repository holds the source code and all assets for the website accessible at [andaryjo.github.io/mcglas](https://andaryjo.github.io/mcglas).

## Just... why?

I myself have a large collection of glasses and was wondering what glasses are from what years and which editions I have complete. A few hours of research later I was able to render a complete list of collections.

There actually is a market for those glasses. Special limited editions or complete sets from a decade ago are really valuable and are sold north of 50 euros.

## Content

The website shows all glass collections since the first edition in 2006. The editions and edition items are maintained in `editions.js`.
While many images for the glasses are from myself, most of the images for the glasses are sourced from the Internet, 
with their sources visible in `images.js`.
